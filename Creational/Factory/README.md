# Factory Pattern

The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple subclasses and based on input, we need to return one of the subclasses. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a Class from the client program to the factory class. We can apply a singleton pattern on the factory class or make the factory method static.
